# Stock-Market-Prediction-
It is a very basic prediction model with graph representations.
The main algorithms are linear regression and decision trees. 
The Colab notebook has been uploaded, you can run the blocks of code but make sure there are no errors after each code execution.
The market data which I have used has also been uploaded as a .csv file. 
Changes to the code are very much welcome. Happy Learning! :)
